        "LangGraph is like a toolbox for building smart programs that use AI (like ChatGPT) to do cool things. It helps you create programs where multiple \"actors\" (think of them as robots or characters) work together to solve problems. These actors can talk to each other, make decisions, and remember what they did before (that's what stateful means)."

        "Teamwork: Just like in a group project, actors can work together to get things done faster.\\\n",
        "Smart Conversations: The actors use something called LLMs (Large Language Models), which are really good at understanding and creating language, like chatting or writing stories.\\\n",
        "Stateful: This means each actor remembers what it was doing. It can keep track of its own progress, just like how you keep notes for your homework.\n",

        "#### a. `from typing import Annotated`\n",
        "- This import brings in `Annotated`, which is a way to add metadata to type hints in Python. It's often used to provide additional context about the type, like constraints or descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### b. `from typing_extensions import TypedDict`\n",
        "- `TypedDict` allows you to define dictionaries with a specific structure in Python. This means you can specify what keys are required and what types of values they should hold. This is useful for creating more readable and maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### c. `from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END`\n",
        "- **`StateGraph`**: This is likely a class that represents a graph structure where nodes can represent different states in a workflow or process. It helps manage transitions between these states.\n",
        "- **`START` and `END`**: These are probably constants representing the starting and ending points of the graph. They help define the boundaries of the process flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### d. `from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages`\n",
        "- **`add_messages`**: This function is likely used to add messages to the state graph. Messages can be important for communication between actors or for maintaining context in workflows.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "#### a. **Annotated**\n",
        "- When you use `Annotated`, you can add extra information to a type. For example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  MyType = Annotated[int, \"This is an integer\"]\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  This means `MyType` is an integer, and the annotation provides additional context.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### b. **TypedDict**\n",
        "- You can define a specific structure for a dictionary. For example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class Person(TypedDict):\n",
        "      name: str\n",
        "      age: int\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  Here, `Person` is a dictionary that must have a `name` (a string) and an `age` (an integer).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### c. **StateGraph**\n",
        "- A state graph organizes states and transitions. Think of it like a flowchart:\n",
        "  - **Nodes** represent states (like tasks).\n",
        "  - **Edges** represent transitions (how to move between tasks).\n",
        "  \n",
        "#### d. **START and END**\n",
        "- These constants help define where the process begins and ends in the state graph. They are essential for ensuring that the workflow is clear and manageable.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### e. **add_messages**\n",
        "- This function helps manage communication within the state graph. It could be used to log messages, send data between actors, or keep track of actions taken.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Putting It All Together**\n",
        "\n",
        "When you combine these components, you can create a structured way to manage workflows with actors. Here's how they might work together:\n",
        "\n",
        "- You define data structures using `TypedDict` to ensure clarity in the data you manage.\n",
        "- You create a `StateGraph` to represent the workflow, using `START` to initiate and `END` to conclude processes.\n",
        "- You can use `add_messages` to facilitate communication and keep track of what’s happening in the workflow.\n",
